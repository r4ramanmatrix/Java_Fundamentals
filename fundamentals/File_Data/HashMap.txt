If your application demands faster insertion and faster retrieval then HashMap is the ultimate choice. While selecting the data structure, you must keep two things in your mind. First one is that the data structure must give better performance while inserting the new elements and second one is that it should give even more better performance while searching for an element. Because insertion and retrieval are two operations which you perform very frequently in your applications. These things will matter even more when you are handling the big data. HashMap is the most sought after data structure when you are handling the big data with more preference to insertion and retrieval operations.
